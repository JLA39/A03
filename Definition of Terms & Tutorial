# Git/Github/Webstorm Tutorial: In this tutorial, the user will learn how to get access to GIT and Github using an IDE. For the first step, the user must download GIT and Webstorm. While these system softwares are downloading, the user will create and set up their own GitHub account at www.Github.com. On this site, the user will then create a repository and clone it on their local machine. It is essential for the user to link their GitHub account to their choice of an IDE - and finally, if everything is downloaded and set up, then the user should be all set to push, pull, and much more with their content between their IDE and Github.
